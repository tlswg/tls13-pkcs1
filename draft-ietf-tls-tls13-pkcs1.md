--- abstract

This document allocates code points for the use of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 with
client certificates in TLS 1.3. This removes an obstacle for some deployments
to migrate to TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}} removed support for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 {{RFC8017}} in
CertificateVerify messages in favor of RSASSA-PSS. While RSASSA-PSS is a
long-established signature algorithm, some legacy hardware cryptographic devices
lack support for it. While uncommon in TLS servers, these devices are sometimes
used by TLS clients for client certificates.

For example, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are ubiquitous hardware
cryptographic devices that are often used to protect TLS client certificate
private keys. However, a large number of TPMs are unable to produce RSASSA-PSS
signatures compatible with TLS 1.3. TPM specifications prior to 2.0 did not
define RSASSA-PSS support (see Section 5.8.1 of {{TPM12}}). TPM 2.0
includes RSASSA-PSS, but only those TPM 2.0 devices compatible with FIPS 186-4
can be relied upon to use the salt length matching the digest length, as
required for compatibility with TLS 1.3 (see Appendix B.7 of {{TPM2}}).

TLS connections that rely on such devices cannot migrate to TLS 1.3. Staying on
TLS 1.2 leaks the client certificate to network attackers
{{?PRIVACY=DOI.10.23919/TMA.2017.8002897}} and additionally prevents such
deployments from protecting traffic against retroactive decryption by an
attacker with a quantum computer {{?I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design}}.

Additionally, TLS negotiates protocol versions before client certificates.
Clients send ClientHellos without knowing whether the server will request to
authenticate with legacy keys. Conversely, servers respond with a TLS
version and CertificateRequest without knowing if the client will then
respond with a legacy key. If the client and server, respectively, offer and
negotiate TLS 1.3, the connection will fail due to the legacy key, when it
previously succeeded at TLS 1.2.

To recover from this failure, one side must globally disable TLS 1.3 or the
client must implement an external fallback. Disabling TLS 1.3 impacts
connections that would otherwise be unaffected by this issue, while external
fallbacks break TLS's security analysis and may introduce vulnerabilities
{{POODLE}}.

This document allocates code points to use these legacy keys with client
certificates in TLS 1.3. This reduces the pressure on implementations to select
one of these problematic mitigations and unblocks TLS 1.3 deployment.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# PKCS#1 v1.5 SignatureScheme Types

The following SignatureScheme values are defined for use with TLS 1.3.

~~~~
    enum {
        rsa_pkcs1_sha256_legacy(0x0420),
        rsa_pkcs1_sha384_legacy(0x0520),
        rsa_pkcs1_sha512_legacy(0x0620),
    } SignatureScheme;
~~~~

The above code points indicate a signature algorithm using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5
{{RFC8017}} with the corresponding hash algorithm as defined in
{{!SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}}. They are only defined for signatures in
the client CertificateVerify message and are not defined for use in other
contexts. In particular, servers intending to advertise support for
RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 signatures in the certificates themselves should use the
`rsa_pkcs1_*` constants defined in {{RFC8446}}.

Clients MUST NOT advertise these values in the `signature_algorithms` extension
of the ClientHello. They MUST NOT accept these values in the server
CertificateVerify message.

Servers that wish to support clients authenticating with legacy
RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5-only keys MAY send these values in the
`signature_algorithms` extension of the CertificateRequest message and accept
them in the client CertificateVerify message. Servers MUST NOT accept these code
points if not offered in the CertificateRequest message.

Clients with such legacy keys MAY negotiate the use of these signature
algorithms if offered by the server.  Clients SHOULD NOT negotiate them with
keys that support RSASSA-PSS, though this may not be practical to determine in
all applications. For example, attempting to test a key for support might
display a message to the user or have other side effects.

TLS implementations SHOULD disable these code points by default. See
{{security-considerations}}.


# Security Considerations

The considerations in {{introduction}} do not apply to server keys, so these new
code points are forbidden for use with server certificates. RSASSA-PSS continues
to be required for TLS 1.3 servers using RSA keys. This minimizes the impact to
only those cases necessary to unblock TLS 1.3 deployment.

When implemented incorrectly, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 admits signature
forgeries {{MFSA201473}}. Implementations producing or verifying signatures
with these algorithms MUST implement RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 as specified in section
8.2 of {{RFC8017}}. In particular, clients MUST include the mandatory NULL
parameter in the DigestInfo structure and produce a valid DER {{X690}}
encoding. Servers MUST reject signatures which do not meet these requirements.


# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to create the following entries in the
TLS SignatureScheme registry, defined in {{!RFC8446}}. The "Recommended" column
should be set to "N", and the "Reference" column should be set to this document.

| Value  |  Description                       |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 0x0420 | `rsa_pkcs1_sha256_legacy` |
| 0x0520 | `rsa_pkcs1_sha384_legacy` |
| 0x0620 | `rsa_pkcs1_sha512_legacy` |
