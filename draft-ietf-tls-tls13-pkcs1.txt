1.  Introduction

   TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] removed support for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 [RFC8017] in
   CertificateVerify messages in favor of RSASSA-PSS.  While RSASSA-PSS
   is a long-established signature algorithm, some legacy hardware
   cryptographic devices lack support for it.  While uncommon in TLS
   servers, these devices are sometimes used by TLS clients for client
   certificates.

   For example, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are ubiquitous hardware
   cryptographic devices that are often used to protect TLS client
   certificate private keys.  However, a large number of TPMs are unable
   to produce RSASSA-PSS signatures compatible with TLS 1.3.  TPM
   specifications prior to 2.0 did not define RSASSA-PSS support (see
   Section 5.8.1 of [TPM12]).  TPM 2.0 includes RSASSA-PSS, but only
   those TPM 2.0 devices compatible with FIPS 186-4 can be relied upon
   to use the salt length matching the digest length, as required for
   compatibility with TLS 1.3 (see Appendix B.7 of [TPM2]).

   TLS connections that rely on such devices cannot migrate to TLS 1.3.
   Staying on TLS 1.2 leaks the client certificate to network attackers
   and additionally prevents such deployments from protecting traffic
   against retroactive decryption by an attacker with a quantum
   computer.

   Moreover, TLS negotiates the protocol version before client
   certificates, so clients and servers cannot smoothly transition
   unaffected connections to TLS 1.3.  As a result, this issue is not
   limited to individual connections that use affected devices.  It
   prevents entire deployments from migrating to TLS 1.3.  See Section 4
   for further discussion.

   This document allocates code points to use these legacy keys with
   client certificates in TLS 1.3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  PKCS#1 v1.5 SignatureScheme Types

   The following SignatureScheme values are defined for use with TLS
   1.3.

       enum {
           rsa_pkcs1_sha256_legacy(0x0420),
           rsa_pkcs1_sha384_legacy(0x0520),
           rsa_pkcs1_sha512_legacy(0x0620),
       } SignatureScheme;

   The above code points indicate a signature algorithm using RSASSA-
   PKCS1-v1_5 [RFC8017] with the corresponding hash algorithm as defined
   in [SHS].  They are only defined for signatures in the client
   CertificateVerify message and are not defined for use in other
   contexts.  In particular, servers intending to advertise support for
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signatures in the certificates themselves should
   use the rsa_pkcs1_* constants defined in [RFC8446].

   Clients MUST NOT advertise these values in the signature_algorithms
   extension of the ClientHello.  They MUST NOT accept these values in
   the server CertificateVerify message.

   Servers that wish to support clients authenticating with legacy
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5-only keys MAY send these values in the
   signature_algorithms extension of the CertificateRequest message and
   accept them in the client CertificateVerify message.  Servers MUST
   NOT accept these code points if not offered in the CertificateRequest
   message.

   Clients with such legacy keys MAY negotiate the use of these
   signature algorithms if offered by the server.  Clients SHOULD NOT
   negotiate them with keys that support RSASSA-PSS.

   TLS implementations SHOULD disable these code points by default.

4.  Security Considerations

   Prior to this document, legacy RSA keys would prevent client
   certificate deployments from adopting TLS 1.3.  The new code points
   allow such deployments to upgrade without replacing the keys.  TLS
   1.3 fixes a privacy flaw [PRIVACY] with client certificates, so
   upgrading is a particular benefit to these deployments.  TLS 1.3 is
   also a prequisite for post-quantum key exchanges
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], necessary for deployments to protect
   traffic against retroactive decryption by an attacker with a quantum
   computer.

   Additionally, TLS negotiates protocol versions before client
   certificates.  Clients send ClientHellos without knowing whether the
   server will request to authenticate with legacy keys.  Conversely,
   servers respond with a TLS version and CertificateRequest without
   knowing if the client will then respond with a legacy key.  If the
   client and server, respectively, offer and negotiate TLS 1.3, the
   connection will fail due to the legacy key, when it previously
   succeeded at TLS 1.2.

   To recover from this failure, one side must globally disable TLS 1.3
   or the client must implement an external fallback.  Disabling TLS 1.3
   impacts connections that would otherwise be unaffected by this issue,
   while external fallbacks break TLS's security analysis and may
   introduce vulnerabilities [POODLE].  The new code points reduce the
   pressure on implementations to select one of these problematic
   mitigations and unblocks TLS 1.3 deployment.

   At the same time, the new code points also reduce the pressure on
   implementations to migrate to RSASSA-PSS.  The above considerations
   do not apply to server keys, so these new code points are forbidden
   for use with server certificates.  RSASSA-PSS continues to be
   required for TLS 1.3 servers using RSA keys.  This minimizes the
   impact to only those cases necessary to unblock TLS 1.3 deployment.

   Finally, when implemented incorrectly, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 admits
   signature forgeries [MFSA201473].  Implementations producing or
   verifying signatures with these algorithms MUST implement RSASSA-
   PKCS1-v1_5 as specified in section 8.2 of [RFC8017].  In particular,
   clients MUST include the mandatory NULL parameter in the DigestInfo
   structure and produce a valid DER [X690] encoding.  Servers MUST
   reject signatures which do not meet these requirements.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the following entries in the TLS
   SignatureScheme registry, defined in [RFC8446].  The "Recommended"
   column should be set to "N", and the "Reference" column should be set
   to this document.

                   +========+=========================+
                   | Value  | Description             |
                   +========+=========================+
                   | 0x0420 | rsa_pkcs1_sha256_legacy |
                   +--------+-------------------------+
                   | 0x0520 | rsa_pkcs1_sha384_legacy |
                   +--------+-------------------------+
                   | 0x0620 | rsa_pkcs1_sha512_legacy |
